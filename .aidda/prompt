revise slide show 

Update the slide show describing the codebase, ensuring it covers the
following points:

- Why it's important
- Who wrote it
    - list ALL co-authors in the codebase
- When they wrote it and what was going on in the world at that time
- How they wrote it (agile, mob programming, etc) 
- What tools were used to write it (mob.sh, mob-consensus, etc)
- What the code does
- How it is organized
    - add a slide with a high-level diagram of the architecture
- Key algorithms and data structures
- Important files and their roles
- Work in progress, bugs, known issues
- What's missing, future plans

Keep it in remarkjs format, see the existing slides in
./slides/README.md, make minimal changes to existing slides, add new
slides as needed, and save it to ./slides/README.md.

analyze usability of current code as storage layer under a graph database

Describe suitability of the current code for use as the storage layer under
a graph database.  Assume the graph is a directed graph with labeled
nodes and edges, and is append-only.  Consider the question of whether
a graph database tends to use a key-value store or a document store as
its storage layer.
