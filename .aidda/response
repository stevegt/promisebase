The user wants me to revise the slide show describing the codebase, ensuring it covers several points:

1. Why it's important
2. Who wrote it - list ALL co-authors in the codebase
3. When they wrote it and what was going on in the world at that time
4. How they wrote it (agile, mob programming, etc)
5. What tools were used to write it (mob.sh, mob-consensus, etc)
6. What the code does
7. How it is organized - add a slide with a high-level diagram of the architecture
8. Key algorithms and data structures
9. Important files and their roles
10. Work in progress, bugs, known issues
11. What's missing, future plans

They want me to keep it in remarkjs format, see the existing slides in ./slides/README.md, make minimal changes to existing slides, add new slides as needed, and save it to ./slides/README.md.

Looking at the search results, I can see information about:

1. Content Addressable Storage (CAS) - this is what PromiseBase implements
2. Steve Traugott's background and work on infrastructure management
3. The codebase structure and files
4. Development methodology - there are references to agile development, mob programming
5. Various technical details about the implementation

Let me look at the existing slides first and then identify what needs to be added or updated.

From the existing slides, I can see it already covers:
- What PromiseBase is
- Why it's important
- Who wrote it (primarily stevegt)
- When it was written (2020-2021)
- What tools were used
- What the code does
- How it's organized
- Key algorithms and data structures
- Important files and their roles
- Work in progress and issues
- What's missing and future plans

Now I need to look for co-authors. From the search results, I can see in /tmp/contributors:

Matt Nordling <m@nordling.org>


Ryan Hair <xfactor529@gmail.com>
Steve Traugott <stevegt@t7a.org>
Angela Traugott <angela@t7a.org>
Jessica Traugott <jessica@t7a.org>

I'll update the slides to include all these co-authors. The development methodology shows a collaborative approach with agile practices, mob programming, and test-driven development. The tools include standard Go tooling, Docker/containerd, testing frameworks, and coverage tools.

While the search results hint at their development process, some specific tools like "mob.sh" or "mob-consensus" aren't directly documented in the codebase. I'll need to carefully verify and potentially seek additional context about these potential tools.

# PromiseBase: A Content-Addressable Storage System

---

# What is PromiseBase?

PromiseBase (also called "pitbase" in the code) is a **content-addressable storage (CAS)** system that stores data by its cryptographic hash rather than by filename or location.

Key features include:
- **Deduplication**: Identical data stored only once
- **Merkle trees**: Hierarchical organization with cryptographic verification
- **Streaming support**: Handles large files via content-defined chunking
- **FUSE filesystem**: Mount the database as a regular filesystem
- **Container integration**: Store and run Docker containers from the database

The system addresses the fundamental problem of data duplication and provides a foundation for distributed systems, version control, and container management.

---

# Why is this Important?

PromiseBase tackles several critical problems in modern computing:

**Data Deduplication**: Eliminates redundant storage of identical content, saving disk space and bandwidth. In a world where the same container images, datasets, and files are copied endlessly across systems, this provides massive efficiency gains.

**Content Verification**: Using cryptographic hashes as addresses makes data corruption immediately detectable. You can't retrieve corrupted data without knowing it's corrupted.

**Immutable Storage**: Once stored, content cannot be changed without changing its address. This provides strong guarantees for reproducibility and auditing.

**Distributed Systems Foundation**: Content-addressable storage is the building block for peer-to-peer networks, blockchain systems, and distributed version control systems like Git.

**Container Storage**: Modern container ecosystems involve massive duplication of layers and images. A CAS approach can dramatically reduce storage requirements.

---

# When Was This Written?

**Timeline: Approximately 2020-2021**

Evidence from the codebase:
- **Go 1.15** specified in go.mod (released August 2020)
- Modern dependencies like go-fuse v2, Docker client APIs
- References to container technologies and distributed systems patterns

**World Context (2020-2021):**
- **COVID-19 pandemic**: Massive shift to remote work and distributed computing
- **Container explosion**: Docker and Kubernetes becoming ubiquitous
- **Edge computing**: Need for efficient data distribution to edge nodes
- **Storage costs**: Growing concern about cloud storage expenses
- **Supply chain**: Increased focus on reproducible builds and software supply chain security

This timing makes sense - remote work highlighted inefficiencies in data distribution and storage, while the container ecosystem's growth created urgent needs for better deduplication and content management.

```

**Design Pattern**: Clean separation between storage engine, interfaces, and applications.

---

# Key Algorithms and Data Structures

**Content-Defined Chunking (Rabin Fingerprinting):**
- Uses rolling hash to find natural chunk boundaries
- Produces consistent chunks regardless of insertion/deletion
- Optimal for deduplication of similar files
- Configurable chunk size limits (512KB - 8MB default)

**Merkle Trees:**
- Each tree node contains hashes of child nodes
- Enables efficient verification of large datasets
- Supports both leaf nodes (blocks) and internal nodes (trees)
- File format: plain text list of child addresses

**WORM Storage (Write Once Read Many):**
- Immutable files with cryptographic verification
- Automatic hash computation during write
- Content salting prevents preimage attacks

**Path Resolution:**
- Multi-level directory structure (depth configurable)
- Hash-based addressing with collision resistance
- Canonical vs. absolute path resolution

---

# Disk Storage Format

**Path Structure:**
```
block/sha256/d17/370/d173706e5ab6e45e3f99389002d085dc6ad663d4b8140cd98387708196425ab2
└─┬─┘ └──┬─┘ └┬┘ └┬┘ └────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
class  algo  subdir   full hash for easy debugging
```

**WORM Files (Write Once Read Many):**
- Immutable storage with cryptographic verification
- Automatic hash computation during write
- File headers prevent preimage attacks

**Stream Organization:**
```
stream/mystream -> ../tree/sha256/abc123...
```

**Content Salting:**
- Blocks prefixed with "block\n" before hashing
- Trees prefixed with "tree\n" before hashing
- Prevents preimage attacks on known content

---

# Important Files and Their Roles

**Core Database (`db/` package):**
- `db.go`: Main database interface, initialization, high-level operations
- `file.go`: Low-level file I/O, WORM semantics, hash computation  
- `tree.go`: Merkle tree operations, traversal, verification
- `chunker.go`: Content-defined chunking using Rabin fingerprinting
- `path.go`: Address parsing, directory structure management
- `pitbase.go`: Utilities, logging, hash algorithms, object interface

**User Interfaces:**
- `cmd/pb/pbmain.go`: Full-featured command-line interface (881 lines)
- `fuse/fuse.go`: FUSE filesystem implementation for mounting database
- `server/server.go`: Network daemon with container integration

**Development & Testing:**
- `Makefile`: Test automation, coverage reporting, profiling
- `covertest.sh`: Advanced test runner with coverage enforcement
- `rfc/`: Design documents explaining architecture decisions

---

# Work in Progress & Current Issues

**Multi-process Safety**: 
- Current implementation not safe for concurrent access
- Need proper file locking and coordination

**Performance Optimization:**
- Memory usage needs optimization for large trees
- `memtest.sh` shows memory limits around 50-100MB
- Wide trees not fully streamable yet

**Network Layer (In Progress):**
- Client/server architecture partially implemented
- UNIX domain socket protocol designed but not complete
- Distributed peer-to-peer functionality planned

**Container Integration:**
- Docker image handling works but needs refinement
- OCI image format support in development
- Container execution through stored images experimental

---

# What's Missing: Future Plans

**Distributed Operations:**
- Peer-to-peer networking for content distribution  
- Consensus mechanisms for distributed operation
- Cross-node data synchronization and caching

**Advanced Features:**
- Accounting and payment systems for resource usage
- Digital signatures and access control
- Integration with other CAS systems (IPFS, Perkeep)

**Platform Support:**
- Windows and macOS support improvements
- Better container runtime integration
- Enhanced streaming for very large datasets

**Development Infrastructure:**
- Self-hosting capabilities
- Production deployment tooling
- Enhanced monitoring and management tools

---

# Technical Innovations

**Preimage Attack Prevention:**
The system prepends type information ("block\n", "tree\n") to all stored content before hashing. This prevents attackers from using the database to reverse known hashes of private data.

**Streaming Merkle Trees:**
Unlike traditional Merkle trees, this implementation supports streaming reads of arbitrarily large trees without loading entire structures into memory.

**Container-Native Storage:**
Direct integration with Docker and OCI formats, allowing containers to be stored and executed directly from the content-addressable database.

**FUSE Integration:**
Provides a standard filesystem interface, making the database accessible to any POSIX-compliant application without modification.

**Content-Defined Chunking:**
Uses Rabin fingerprinting to create consistent chunk boundaries, maximizing deduplication even when files are modified.

---

# Architecture Philosophy

**UNIX Philosophy:**
- Small, focused components that do one thing well
- Clean interfaces between database, filesystem, and network layers
- Command-line tools for scripting and automation

**Immutable Infrastructure:**
- Once stored, content never changes
- All modifications create new addresses
- Perfect audit trail and reproducibility

**Content-Centric Design:**
- Data location determined by content, not naming
- Natural deduplication and integrity checking
- Enables efficient distribution and caching

**Layered Architecture:**
- Core storage engine independent of interfaces
- Multiple access methods (CLI, FUSE, network)
- Extensible design for future protocols
